# qpcr-in-r
A script to analyse qPCR results using R and the EasyqpcR package

# What remains to be done

## User should select a one-factor design or a two-factor design

## Being able to choose the real primer efficiency instead of the theoretical 2 efficiency
This needs to be an extra column in the dataset (primer efficiency already filled in 2s)

## Make sure NA values are properly labeled (blanks)

## Interactive part needed when plotting the technical replicates to remove potential biological replicates outliers
Removing some samples if needed. Continuing with the averaging of the technical replicates.

## Add points to the boxplots
